I have total 4 credit cards and this one comes with one of the most painful customer support that one can ever get. The card promises some of the very good cashbacks on certain partners.  It offers 5% unlimited cashback on final payment value on Flipkart and Myntra which is really nice.  The problem comes with 4% cashback category of Makemytrip and GoIbibo. Here the cashback never comes and customer is left clueless as to whom to contact for support. Makemytrip customer support denies any such cashback and axis bank delegates the responsibility to MMT. So customer is left with no support whatsoever.

Very less annual fees.
